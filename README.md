# Ethereum Predictious AI Bot 
This is a Flask API that predicts future Ethereum price based on four variables: average block size, block time, block count, and uncle count. The respective data were collected from etherscan.io. Multivariate linear regression machine learning was used in the training, which was done utilizing Tensorflow and Numpy/pandas. 

To run the program, download the repository, and type in the command: 
```
$ cd Flask
$ python server.py
```
Note: You need to have Tensorflow, Flask, and Anaconda downloaded in your environment.
